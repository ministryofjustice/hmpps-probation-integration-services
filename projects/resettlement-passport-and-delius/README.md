# Resettlement Passport and Delius

Service that provides API interfaces to Delius giving access probation case information needed by the resettlement process for prison leavers. We also provide APIs to add case note and appointment information to the Delius contact log.

## Business Need

Supporting the [Resettlement Passport API](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-resettlement-passport-api) with information from Delius and enabling the service to add data to Delius as required.

## Data Dependencies

_Resettlement Passport_ depends on _Delius_ data for background on the relevant **Person on Probation** and the specific **Probation Case**. The _Resettlement Passport_ system creates _Delius_ **Contacts** to represent **Appointments** and **NOMIS Case Notes**.
