## Custody Key Dates Recorded in Delius

Prison API provides a set of dates recorded in NOMIS that are recorded in the Throughcare section of Delius when the key dates updates are triggered. The dates are displayed in the 'Throughcare Dates' and 'Additional Throughcare Dates' section of the 'Throughcare Details' screen, which is accessed via the Delius Event. All dates that do not match the existing Delius values will be updated on receiving an event trigger. The custody dates obtained via Prison API are:

- Sentence Expiry Date
- Licence Expiry Date
- Conditional Release Date / Override Date
- Expected Release Date
- Home Detention Curfew Eligibility Date
- Post Sentence Supervision End Date
