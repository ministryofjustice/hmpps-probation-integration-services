# Make Recall Decisions and Delius

## Business Need

Supports integration between the
[Consider a Recall](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/make-recall-decision-api)
(previously Make a Recall Decision) service and
[Delius](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/delius). The service
provides an API for gathering data on the person on probation and the
probation case history, including case documents. The service also listens for
events produced by the Consider a Recall service in order to reflect the
activity around recall decisions in the Delius contact history.
