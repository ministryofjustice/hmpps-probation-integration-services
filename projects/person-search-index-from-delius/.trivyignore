CVE-2022-1471

# Reason:
#   Given the CVE description, the changes in the JDK source code and the information publicly available we believe that Logstash is not affected by any of the aforementioned flaws.
#   Logstash bundles a JDK with all download artifacts ( archives, RPM/DEB packages, Docker images ).
#   Logstash versions 8.4.0 and 7.17.6 that are released on 2022-08-24 bundle unaffected JDK versions. Namely, Logstash version 8.4.0 bundles JDK 17.0.4 and Logstash version 7.17.6 bundles JDK 11.0.16.
