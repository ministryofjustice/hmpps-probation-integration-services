# Approved Premises and Delius

Service that responds to Approved Premises domain events, calls the
[HMPPS Approved Premises API](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-approved-premises-api)
and records referral progress against the probation case record in Delius. We
also provide an API to give probation case information to support making
approved premises referrals.

## Business Need

Supporting the Approved Premises service with the correct information required
to make an Approved Premises application and ensuring the Probation
Practitioner has an up-to-date view of activity in the Approved Premises
service when interacting with the probation case via Delius.

## Data Dependencies

_Approved Premises (CAS1)_ depends on _Delius_ data for background on the relevant **Person on Probation** and the specific **Probation Case** when making an approved premises referral. There is also a dependency on **Probation Practitioner** information and **Probation Documents** used in the referral process.

## Workflows

Approved Premises domain events are raised in real time as approved premises
referrals are processed. The progressive stages of a referral are raised as
separate events.

### Approved Premises Referral Application Workflows

_Approved Premises (CAS1)_ referral activity is reflected in _Delius_ via simple notification contacts, intended to log updates to the case and inform probation practitioners of changes.

| Business Event                                        | HMPPS Domain Event Type                 |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|

### Approved Premises Booking Workflows

_Approved Premises (CAS1)_ bookings are reflected in _Delius_ via the entries in the `APPROVED_PREMISES` database table, which appear in the _Delius_ UI as the **Approved Premises Diary** and **Approved Premises Referrals** screens. The information held in Delius is kept up-to-date with the activity in the _Approved Premises CAS1_ service via processing of specific domain events. The information is duplicated in _Delius_ for the purposes of maintaining MIS reports that depend on certain aspects of the data related to arrival and departure dates.
