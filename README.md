A collection of small, domain-focused integrations to support HMPPS Digital services that need to interact with 
probation data. Typically, these integration services will perform translations between HMPPS and Delius domain 
concepts, and are responsible for:
* publishing REST endpoints to read existing data from the Delius database
* listening for HMPPS Domain Event messages and writing data into the Delius database

# Project
## Goals
This project is intended to reduce the surface area of larger integration systems (e.g. [Community API](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/community-api)),
and to replace other components (e.g. [Case Notes to Probation](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/case-notes-to-probation))
with simpler services that have direct access to the Delius database.

With this in mind, we aim to:
* Support HMPPS Digital teams by building and deploying at pace
* Separate overlapping domain concepts by creating smaller, more focused services
* Simplify the developer experience by unifying common approaches and streamlining workflows

## Design Decisions
* Each service serves one, and only one, client
* Services have a single well-defined purpose
* Entities/projections are defined using domain-specific language (e.g. CaseNote, not Contact)

A full list of decision records can be found in [decisions](decisions). (**TODO**)

## Tooling
* Code is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
* Built and tested as a multi-project [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) build
* Unit tests with [JUnit](https://junit.org/) and [Mockito](https://mockito.org/)
* Integration tests with [Hoverfly](https://hoverfly.io/), [H2](https://www.h2database.com/), and [embedded ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/)
* End-to-end testing **TBC**
* Docker images are built with [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib#readme)
* Code formatting by [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/)
* Continuous integration with [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions)

# Development
The project is configured to enable developers to build/test/run integration services in isolation without the need for 
Docker or remote dependencies.

To set up your development environment,
1. Open the project in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
2. To run tests for a service, right-click the `src/test` folder in the project view and select "Run tests".  See [Test](#test).
3. To start the service, use the pre-defined run configuration in `.idea/runConfigurations` (See [Run](#run)).

## Code formatting
Kotlin code is formatted using [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/). IntelliJ will detect the ktlint configuration in 
[.idea/codeStyles](.idea/codeStyles) and [.idea/inspectionProfiles](.idea/inspectionProfiles) and ensure formatting is 
applied consistently in your IDE.

To fix any formatting issues in your code locally, run 
```
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

Or, to add a pre-commit hook to automatically fix any formatting issues, run:
```shell
./gradlew addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook
```

# Build
IntelliJ will automatically build your code as needed. Any tasks you run from the root project, without specifying a project name will be ran on all the children.
To build the entire repository using Gradle, run:
```shell
./gradlew build
```

To build just a specific project.
```shell
./gradlew <project-name>:build
```

Use buildDependents to build and test all projects that depend on a given project (for instance a shared library)
```shell
./gradlew <project-name>:buildDependents
```

## Docker
To build Docker images and push to your local repository, run:
```shell
./gradlew <project-name>:jibDockerBuild
```

# Run
## IntelliJ
In IntelliJ IDEA, a [run configuration](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) is available 
for each service. Select it from the toolbar, and click either Run or Debug. The service will start in the `dev` 
profile, which typically auto-configures embedded test data and services.

Run configurations are stored in [.idea/runConfigurations](.idea/runConfigurations).

## Gradle
To run Gradle tasks in a sub-project, prepend the task name with the name of the project. Environment variables can be 
used to set the dev profile. For example,
```shell
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev ./gradlew <project-name>:bootRun
```

# Test
## Integration tests
Integration tests use Hoverfly JSON files to mock any external services.

**TODO** add more details when test implementation is complete.

# Deploy
Services are deployed to the Delius AWS ECS cluster, which gives them direct access to the Delius database. The
infrastructure code is maintained here: [probation-integration-services](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-delius-core-terraform/tree/main/application/probation-integration-services).

To access queues or other resources in MOJ Cloud Platform, you should add an IAM policy that grants access to one of the
following roles ([example](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/blob/7a028911f8ed459a30e98d8dbba8cdcf7283ac93/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/offender-events-dev/resources/case-notes-sub-queue.tf#L42-L57)):
* Dev/Test: `arn:aws:iam::728765553488:role/delius-test-ecs-sqs-consumer`
* Pre-Prod: `arn:aws:iam::010587221707:role/delius-pre-prod-ecs-sqs-consumer`
* Production: `arn:aws:iam::050243167760:role/delius-prod-ecs-sqs-consumer`
