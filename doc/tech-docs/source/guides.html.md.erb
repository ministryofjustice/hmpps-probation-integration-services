# How-To Guides

## Making an Authenticated API Request

Authentication tokens can be obtained from the internal HMPPS OAuth server,
[HMPPS Auth](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-auth), using Client
Credentials Flow. Specific credentials for accessing an integration service
are supplied by the 'HMPPS Auth, Audit and Registers' team. The client should
be configured with the correct scopes and authorities for accessing the API
endpoints provided by the integration service and these will then be present
in the supplied JWT.

```bash
# Client credentials - supplied by 'HMPPS Auth, Audit and Registers' team
CLIENT_ID=<hmpps-auth-client-id>
CLIENT_SECRET=<hmpps-auth-client-secret>

# Request a JWT access token
AUTH_TOKEN=$(
	curl -s --location \
		--request POST "https://sign-in.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/auth/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials" \
		--user "$CLIENT_ID:$CLIENT_SECRET" |
		jq -r .access_token
)

# Inspect the JWT and ensure scopes and authorities are correct
jwt decode $AUTH_TOKEN
```

To make a request to the API submit a `GET` request to an endpoint in the
integration service, supplying the JWT access token as a bearer token in an
`Authorization` header.


```bash
curl -s --location https://<integration-service-name>.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/case-details/X633793/1 \
        --header "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"
```
