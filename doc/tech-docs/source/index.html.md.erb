# About

A collection of small, domain-focused integrations to support HMPPS Digital services that need to interact with
probation data. Typically, these integration services will perform translations between HMPPS and Delius domain
concepts, and are responsible for:

* publishing REST endpoints to read existing data from the Delius database
* listening for HMPPS Domain Event messages and writing data into the Delius database
