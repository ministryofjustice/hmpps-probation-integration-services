# Requesting an Integration Service

Hello! If you are building a digital service in HMPPS that needs to interact with probation case data in NDelius, then
you are in the right place.

This guide outlines how the **Probation Integration** team works with client teams like yours to build secure, reliable,
and domain-focused integrations.

## How we integrate

A probation integration service typically acts as
an [anti-corruption layer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/anti-corruption-layer) that
connects your HMPPS digital or domain service to the NDelius probation case management system.
Adding this layer helps define a meaningful domain and responsibility boundary - allowing us to hide the complexity of
NDelius and provide a stable, well-defined interface for your service to interact with the data it needs.

Most integrations involve a combination of the following capabilities:

* **Reading Data:** Providing REST API endpoints to read existing probation data in the format your service needs.
* **Writing Data:**
  Consuming [HMPPS Domain Event](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-domain-events#hmpps-domain-events)
  messages to map and write data back asynchronously.

Every digital service will get their own dedicated integration - they are not shared between clients.
This allows us to build integrations that are tailored to the specific needs of each team.

## Roadmap

Here is the typical roadmap for working with us, from discussion to production.
Timescales vary depending on the complexity of the integration, but we aim to move as quickly as possible.

### 1. Requirements

Everything starts with a conversation.
We'll meet to understand your use case, data requirements, and timelines.
This helps us align our teams and set expectations early.

At this stage, we may need a few follow-up sessions to clarify details.
We may also need to include other teams (e.g. the National Delius Service Team) to confirm what's possible.

### 2. Ongoing communication

We believe in close collaboration - for asking questions, sharing updates, and resolving issues quickly.
Here are the main channels we use:

* **Slack:** We will create a shared Slack channel (e.g., `#topic-pi-<your-project>`) for day-to-day questions and dev
  support.
* **Weekly Catch-up (Optional):** During the active design and development phases, we can schedule a weekly catch-up to
  discuss changes to requirements, unblock any issues and track progress.

### 3. Design

Before writing code, we agree on the contracts:

* **APIs:** We define the endpoints, request parameters, and response structures for any data you need to read.
* **Events:** You define the domain event type that your service will publish. You may also need to define a "detail"
  API to enable sharing of sensitive data -
  see [Handling sensitive data](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PINT/pages/3916103711/HMPPS+Domain+Events#Handling-sensitive-data).

Once the design has been agreed, we will add stories to
our [Jira board](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PI/boards/5627) under a single epic.

### 4. Development

We will build the integration service and deploy it to the `dev` and `preprod` environments -
see [Environments](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-probation-integration-services#environments).
Once it's ready for you to start testing against, we will share an update on Slack.

At this point you can start hooking up your dev service and start testing.
If you spot any issues, or need any changes, get in touch on Slack - we are happy to help!

### 5. Testing

At this point, we will add an automated test to validate the end-to-end user journey - setting up cases in NDelius,
completing the required steps in your service, and verifying data is flowing correctly.
See [End-to-end testing](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-probation-integration-services#end-to-end-tests).

To support this, we may ask you to grant permissions to our test user accounts in the `dev` environment.

Depending on the scope of your service, the National Delius Service Team (NDST) may also need to do some manual testing
to validate the impact on the NDelius system.

### 6. Go Live

Once an end-to-end test is in place and passing, the integration service will be deployed to production.
Then it's up to you to start using it 🚀

## Support

Our partnership doesn't end at "Go Live".
For ongoing questions, troubleshooting, or future enhancements, you can always reach us in your dedicated Slack channel
or our general support channel: [#probation-integration-tech](https://moj.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C02HQ4M2YQN).

### Monitoring

We continuously monitor the integration services and will be alerted of any exceptions.
We will proactively investigate and resolve issues, keeping you informed of any significant incidents.

If you notice any issues from your side, please reach out on Slack.
